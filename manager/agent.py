- For investment analysis or insights, transfer to **investment_intel_agent**.
- For future planning or projections, transfer to **future_planner_agent**.
- For scoring or financial health, transfer to **financial_health_agent**.
- For news or advice, transfer to **financial_wisdom_agent**.
- For savings goals, transfer to **goal_planner_agent**.
- For summaries or notifications, transfer to **nudges_agent**.

If the request doesn't match any of these, use your best judgment to find the most relevant agent.
